The tiny difference between the paper and the program:

1. Partial level <=1 tree. 
	If (P,-1) is a partial level-1 tree, it is realized by 
		(P,nullptr) 
in the program.
	If (P,p) is a partial level-1 tree, it is realized by 
		(P,p-)
where p- is the node in the tree P. The pointer to p- must be exactly the pointer in P that represents p-.

2. Partial level <=2 tree. 
	If (Q,(0,-1,emptyset)) is a partial level <=2 tree, it is realized by 
		(	
			Q,
			empty_leq_2_node,
			(trivial_lv1_tree,nullptr),
			DIRECTION::NA
		) 
in the program.
	If (Q,(1,q,emptyset)) is a partial level <=2 tree, it is realized by 
		(	
			Q,
			(1,q-),
			(trivial_lv1_tree,nullptr),
			DIRECTION::DOWN
		) 
in the program. The DIRECTION::DOWN means that the hanging node is going downwards from (1,q-). 
	If (Q,(2,q,P)) is a partial level <=2 tree, if q has an elder sister whose tree component is the same as q, it is realized by 		
		(	
			Q,
			(2,the_next_elder_sister_of_q_with_same_tree_component),
			(P,p),
			DIRECTION::LEFT
		) 
The DIRECTION::LEFT means that the hanging node is going leftwards from (2,the_next_elder_sister_of_q_with_same_tree_component). p is the last node in P according to the enumeration of Q, i.e. the hanging node of Q(2,q-). 
	If (Q,(2,q,P)) is a partia level <=2 tree, but q doesn't have an elder sister whose tree component is the same as q, it is realized by 
		(	
			Q,
			(2,q-),
			(P,p),
			DIRECTION::DOWN
		) 
The DIRECTION::DOWN means that the hanging node is going downwards from (2,q-). p is the last node in P according to the enumeration of Q, i.e. the hanging node of Q(2,q-).
